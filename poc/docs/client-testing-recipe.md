# Client Testing Recipe for Gemini

üéØ **Goal**: Test the new context-aware client without touching the server  
üìç **Location**: This is the **Patient Box** - just test the client changes  
üñ•Ô∏è **Server**: Already running on BeeLink (10.55.0.1:8080) - don't change anything there!

## ‚úÖ Client Implementation Status

Great work! The implementation looks complete:
- ‚úÖ Multi-line input handler (`get_multiline_input`)
- ‚úÖ Intent classification (`analyze_user_intent`) 
- ‚úÖ Context management (`add_to_context`, `get_context_for_api`)
- ‚úÖ Enhanced API calls (`diagnose` with context)
- ‚úÖ Main loop integration

## üß™ Testing Steps

### Step 1: Basic Connection Test
```bash
cd /home/alex/Projects/iHomeNerd/RoadNerd/poc/core
python3 roadnerd_client.py
```

**Expected**: Should connect to server at 10.55.0.1:8080 and show:
```
‚úì Connected to bee-link-ubuntu
  Running: Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS
  LLM: ollama
```

### Step 2: Single-Line Input Test (Backward Compatibility)
```
ü§ñ RoadNerd> what OS version do I have?
```

**Expected**: Should work exactly like before - ask for system info

### Step 3: Multi-Line Paste Test (The Big Fix!)
```
ü§ñ RoadNerd> cat /etc/os-release
PRETTY_NAME="Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS"
NAME="Ubuntu"
VERSION_ID="24.04"

[press Enter on empty line to submit]
```

**Expected**: Should detect as "information" and say:
```
üìù Information noted (X confidence)
What would you like me to help you with regarding this information?
```

### Step 4: Follow-up Question Test
```
ü§ñ RoadNerd> What version of Ubuntu is this?
```

**Expected**: Should use the context from step 3 to answer intelligently

### Step 5: Problem Detection Test
```
ü§ñ RoadNerd> My WiFi is not working
```

**Expected**: Should detect as "problem" and go through normal diagnosis

### Step 6: Command Execution (Approval)
```
ü§ñ RoadNerd> execute whoami
ü§ñ RoadNerd> execute id
ü§ñ RoadNerd> execute ping -c 1 1.1.1.1
```

**Expected**: Commands run on server; outputs shown. For KB fixes, when prompted ‚ÄúExecute suggested fix? (y/n)‚Äù, test both n then y.

## ‚ûï Additional Scenarios (Conversational)

See also: `conversational-testing-scenarios.md` for detailed flows.

- Multi‚Äëturn context: paste `/etc/os-release` then ask about the version.
- Problem ‚Üí info ‚Üí fix: state a WiFi problem, paste `nmcli dev status`, ask for next steps.
- Enders: finish large pastes using empty line, ``` or `END`.
- Large paste guardrail: try ~200 lines of syslog; ensure responsiveness.
- Safety: try a benign blocked command (e.g., `execute rm -rf /tmp/should_not_exist`).

## üßæ Documenting Test Results

Use this template to record outcomes (copy/paste and fill in):

```
Environment
- Client host: <hostname>, OS, Python
- Server host: <hostname>, IPs, LLM backend
- Client commit: <hash/date> (if applicable)

Results
- Basic connection: PASS/FAIL (notes)
- Single-line input: PASS/FAIL (notes)
- Multi-line paste: PASS/FAIL (notes)
- Intent classification: PASS/FAIL (notes)
- Context accumulation: PASS/FAIL (notes)
- Problem diagnosis flow: PASS/FAIL (notes)
- Command execution (whoami/id/ping): PASS/FAIL (outputs)
- KB fix approval (n and y): PASS/FAIL (what ran)
- Edge cases (Ctrl-D/help): PASS/FAIL (behavior)

Artifacts
- Integration log: /tmp/rn_integration.log
- Interactive log: /tmp/rn_interactive.log
```

Tips
- Capture full outputs with `tee` or `script`.
- Note any latency or memory spikes and which scenario caused them.

## üîç What to Watch For

### ‚úÖ Success Indicators
- Multi-line input ends on empty line (no more line-by-line processing)
- Intent classification shows up (information/problem/question)
- Context accumulates between interactions
- No "EOF when reading" errors

### ‚ùå Failure Signs
- Still processes line-by-line (old problem)
- Crashes on multi-line input
- Can't connect to server
- Intent classification always wrong

## üö® If Something Goes Wrong

### Server Connection Issues
**Don't try to fix the server!** It's running fine on BeeLink.
```bash
# Just verify server is reachable:
curl -s http://10.55.0.1:8080/api/status
```

### Client Crashes
```bash
# Restore backup and compare:
cp roadnerd_client.py.backup roadnerd_client.py
# Then retry implementation
```

### Import Errors
```bash
# Check imports at top of file:
import re
from datetime import datetime
```

## üìä Test Results Template

Please report results like this:

```
‚úÖ Basic connection: PASS/FAIL
‚úÖ Single-line input: PASS/FAIL  
‚úÖ Multi-line paste: PASS/FAIL
‚úÖ Intent classification: PASS/FAIL
‚úÖ Context accumulation: PASS/FAIL
```

## üéØ Success Criteria

**The fix is working if:**
1. **Multi-line paste** doesn't trigger line-by-line analysis
2. **System info paste** gets classified as "information" 
3. **Follow-up questions** reference previous context
4. **No regression** in basic functionality

## üí° Key Point for Gemini

**You don't need to touch the server** - it's already running and will handle the new client payload gracefully. The server might not use all the new context info yet, but that's fine for testing the client changes.

Focus on proving the **client-side improvements work**: multi-line input, intent detection, and context accumulation.

Ready to test! üöÄ
