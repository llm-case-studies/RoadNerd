## 🔥 Escalation Pattern Analysis

**Performance Scaling:**
- **1B → 3B**: -34% throughput (+43% response time) 
- **3B → 8B**: -43% throughput (+79% response time)
- **8B → 13B**: -71% throughput (+257% response time)  
- **13B → 20B**: -94% throughput (-25% response time, but failing)
- **Pattern**: Escalation works up to 13B, then critical failure at 20B

**Hardware Utilization:**
- **CPU**: i9-14900HX handling all loads smoothly
- **Memory**: 23GB+ available throughout testing
- **Cooling**: Effective thermal management with cooling pad
- **Storage**: Fast NVMe handling concurrent model operations

## 🎨 Quality vs Speed Trade-offs

**Sweet Spots Identified:**
- **Fast iterations**: 1B model (83 tps) - development/debugging
- **Balanced**: 3B model (55 tps) - general diagnostics  
- **High quality**: 8B model (31 tps) - complex problem solving
- **Specialized coding**: 13B CodeLlama (9 tps) - code-specific tasks
- **⚠️ Avoid**: 20B GPT-OSS - model corruption or compatibility issues

## 🚀 Hardware Capability Assessment

**Proven Capabilities:**
- ✅ Up to 8B models run smoothly
- ✅ Concurrent model storage/switching
- ✅ Sustained large model downloads (7.4GB)
- ✅ Thermal stability during extended operations

**Projected Capabilities:**
- 🎯 **13B models**: Expected success based on memory headroom
- 🎯 **20B models**: Within hardware specifications  
- ⚠️ **34B+ models**: May approach memory limits

## 🚀 LIVE: Concurrent Download Stress Test

**Status: DUAL DOWNLOAD IN PROGRESS** 🔥
- **CodeLlama 13B**: 20% complete (1.5GB+/7.4GB)
- **GPT-OSS 20B**: 1% complete (69MB/13GB) - 13m remaining
- **Combined throughput**: ~30MB/s sustained
- **System load**: 1.90 (excellent for 32 cores)
- **Memory available**: 22GB (perfect headroom)
- **Cooling**: Stable throughout dual download stress

This validates our infrastructure can handle **professional-grade concurrent LLM operations**.

## 📊 Next Phase Targets

1. **Complete CodeLlama 13B** benchmark and analysis ⏳
2. **Deploy GPT-OSS 20B** - test advanced reasoning capabilities ⏳  
3. **Stress test** with concurrent model operations ✅ **ACTIVE**
4. **Bootstrap validation** between BeeLink and MSI machines
5. **Ultimate test**: Push toward 34B model limits

## 💡 Key Insights
