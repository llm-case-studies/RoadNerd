  - Test all documented scenarios from testing recipes
  - Validate auto-discovery works with 10.55.0.x subnet
  - Document any connection reliability issues

- [ ] **Real-World Scenario Testing**
  - DNS resolution problems
  - WiFi adapter issues  
  - Network interface configuration problems
  - Multi-step troubleshooting workflows
  - Performance under different system loads

### **Friday: Quick Wins & Polish**
- [ ] **Enhanced Auto-Discovery**
  - Add 10.55.0.x to client default subnet scan
  - Improve server detection speed and reliability
  - Add connection status feedback to user
  - Test multi-interface scenarios

- [ ] **Safety Improvements**
  - Expand dangerous command patterns (`rm -rf`, `dd if=`, `mkfs`)
  - Add token-level safety analysis
  - Improve command preview with risk assessment
  - Test safe mode edge cases

## ðŸš€ **Next Week (Priority 2)**

### **Monday-Wednesday: Client Bootstrap System**
- [ ] **Server-Side Bootstrap Endpoints**
  - Implement `/bootstrap.sh` endpoint (from GPT5 feedback)
  - Create `/download/client.py` file serving
  - Add auto-detection of server IP in bootstrap script
  - Test zero-install client deployment

- [ ] **Client Enhancement**
  - Fix help command recursion bug
  - Improve multi-line input handling edge cases
  - Add connection retry mechanisms
  - Enhanced error messages and user guidance

### **Thursday-Friday: Model Escalation Foundation**
- [ ] **Basic Model Ladder**
  - Define model escalation tiers (3b â†’ 7b â†’ 13b)
  - Create stateless escalation API endpoints
  - Implement `/harder` and `/hardest` client commands
  - Test model switching without context loss

- [ ] **Environment Variable Enhancements**
  - Improve `RN_MODEL` switching robustness
  - Add `RN_ESCALATION_LADDER` configuration
  - Test rapid model switching scenarios
  - Document environment configuration options
